# Notnet.Controls
Some Xamarin Forms controls

Not much to see yet, though:

* A semi-working GalleryView
* Pull-to-Refresh ListView for iOS and Android

The WrapLayout class is taken from https://github.com/conceptdev/xamarin-forms-samples/blob/master/Evolve13/Evolve13/Controls/WrapLayout.cs.
I have made a minor update to it, that makes the grid items resize to fill the parent view a bit better

The pull to refresh implementation is more or less taken from https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Xamarin.Forms-Awesome-Controls

There is a small test project shows an example in how to use the controls.
